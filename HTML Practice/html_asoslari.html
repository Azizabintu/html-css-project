       <P>Lorem Ipsum is <b> simply dummy</b> <i> text of the printing and typesetting industry</i> .<br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
             <hr>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make <br>
              a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also <br>
               the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </P>

        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
